## XML to CSV Converter
# Overview

The XML to CSV Converter is a Python script designed to facilitate the conversion of XML data into CSV format. This tool simplifies the process of transforming XML files into structured tabular data, which can be easily manipulated and analyzed using spreadsheet software or other data processing tools.
# Features

  XML to CSV Conversion: Converts XML files into CSV format, allowing for seamless integration with existing data pipelines and workflows.
  Nested XML Handling: Handles nested XML structures by flattening them into a tabular format. This ensures that complex XML data with hierarchical relationships can be accurately represented in the resulting CSV files.
  Flexible Configuration: Supports customization of input and output file paths, allowing users to specify the location of XML input files and the desired output directory for the generated CSV files.
  Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for XML parsing and conversion failures, enabling users to quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the conversion process.

# Usage

  Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

  bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/xml-to-csv-converter.git

**Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. No additional dependencies are required to run the converter script.

**Prepare XML Files:** Place your XML files in the specified input folder. These XML files should contain the data that you wish to convert to CS**V format.

**Run the Script:** Execute the Python script to convert the XML files to CSV format. Adjust the input and output folder paths as needed by modifying the conversion.py script.

bash

    python conversion.py

  **Check Output:** The converted CSV files will be generated in the specified output folder. You can now use these CSV files for further analysis or processing.

# Example

Suppose you have a set of XML files containing data about different departments within a university. Each XML file represents information such as department names, faculty details, and course offerings. By running the XML to CSV Converter, you can transform these XML files into CSV format, making the data more accessible and easier to analyze. For example:

  The XML file data.xml may contain information about the Computer Science department, including details about faculty members, courses, and students.
  The XML file data2.xml may contain similar information about the Mathematics department, with its own set of faculty, courses, and students.

After running the converter script, you will obtain CSV files (data.csv, data2.csv, etc.) corresponding to each XML input file, containing structured tabular data that can be easily imported into spreadsheet software or databases for analysis.
